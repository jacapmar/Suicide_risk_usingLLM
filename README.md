# ðŸ“Š Predicting Suicide Risk Using Machine Learning and Large Language Models

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that build a text classifier to detect whether a post is related to suicide or not. Each notebook uses a different Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique:

    ðŸ§  TF-IDF vectorization (already added)

    ðŸ§¬ Word embeddings with SpaCy (coming soon)
